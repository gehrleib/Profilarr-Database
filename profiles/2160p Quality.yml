name: 2160p Quality
description: '**Transparent Encoding Focus:**

  - Prioritizes transparent x265 4K encodes using the **Encode Efficiency Index (EEi)**
  metric with a target ratio of 55%.


  **Tiered Quality System:**

  - Employs 4 primary quality tiers, prioritizing encodes from reputable groups.

  - Fallback options include high-quality WEB-DLs and balanced tier groups.

  - Two additional lower quality tiers are included for further fallback.


  **Specialized Format Considerations:**

  - HDR and lossless audio formats receive special consideration.

  - Encodes with superior HDR or lossless audio sources can be prioritized over higher-tiered
  encodes with lesser sources.


  **Fallback Logic:**

  - If no 2160p release is found, the system automatically falls back to a transparent
  1080p.'
