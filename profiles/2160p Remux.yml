name: 2160p Remux
description: '**Quality-Driven Selection:**

  - Instead of relying on release group metrics, 2160p Remux prioritizes lossless
  UHD Blu-ray copies based on audio and video feature tags.

  - This strategy prevents "circular downloads" where upgrades offer minimal improvement.


  **Feature-Based Upgrades**

  - Upgrades are triggered by specific audio/video metadata, including: Dolby Vision,
  TrueHD, Atmos, and HDR10+

  - This ensures selection of superior versions, even from non-standard release groups.

  - Example: a hybrid WEB-DoVi remux will be prefered over a non hybrid remux


  **Fallback Logic:**

  - If a 2160p Remux is unavailable, the system defaults to 2160p WEB-DLs.

  - If 2160p WEB-DLs are also unavailable, the system falls back to 1080p Remux, and
  so on.'
